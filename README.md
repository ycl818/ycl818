### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Yi-Chien Lee, an alumnus of Northeastern University.

Hereâ€™s my personal website: [Portfolio](https://yichien-lee.vercel.app/)

Currently, I'm learning swift! Can't wait to share my projects here!

My skillsets include programming languages like JavaScript, Python, SQL, and C/C++.

Flexible in Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

I do this because I love it. I love the process of software development, whereby you can make a real commercial website that many can use.
