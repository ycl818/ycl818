### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Yi-Chien Lee. I am an alumnus of Northeastern University.

Hereâ€™s my personal website: https://yichien-lee.netlify.app

Currently, I'm devloping a game in C++ with Ureal Engine. Can't wait to share with you!

My skillsets include languages like JavaScript, Python, SQL, C/C++, React. 

I do this because I love it. I love the process of software development, whereby you can make a real commercial website that many can use.

I'm looking for a job that allow me to realize my passion!
