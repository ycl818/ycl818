### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Yi-Chien Lee, an alumnus of Northeastern University.

Hereâ€™s my personal website: [Portfolio](https://yichien-lee.vercel.app/)

I am a software developer with a passion for building web applications using React. Currently, I'm learning Swift, but my main focus is on building robust and scalable web applications using React. 

My skillsets include programming languages like JavaScript, Python, SQL, and C/C++. I also have experience with technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.

Flexible in Windows, macOS, and Linux, I am dedicated to providing elegant solutions that meet the needs of my clients and users. 

I do this because I love it. I love the process of software development, whereby you can make a real commercial website that many can use. Let's connect and build something amazing together!
